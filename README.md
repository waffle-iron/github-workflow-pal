- **Merge button safe-guards**

    The merge button is enabled on PRs only after you explicitly declare to have checked a few conditions, namely:
    - **requirements** to be in sync with the specs (if applicable)
    - **specs** to be in sync with the implementation (if applicable)
    - **test plan** to be present and checked

    This purely serves as a reminder, and doesn't perform any further checks.

- **'New buildo issue' button**

  Add a 'New buildo issue' button for quick creation of issues specific to buildo's workflow.
